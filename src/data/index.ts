    the opportunity to have worked with Ehsan as extremely rewarding. <br />
    Even though we started out in different teams, Ehsan has always been

    <br />
    Over the past two years, Ehsan and I have worked closely together on a
    variety of projects, each differing in size and complexity. Besides his
    excellent ability to break down tasks and problems and provide high
    quality code to efficiently solve even the most demanding task we have
    had, Ehsan also has the ability to convey the essence of a problem and
    explain both the ‘how’ and the ‘why’ it should be solved to junior devs
    as well as customers alike.
    <br />
    <br />
    But working with Ehsan is also challenging in the best possible way. He
    is always on the lookout for new tech and ideas, on how to do things
    better. This is something from which everyone in our team has benefitted
    from. Over a great many cups of tea, we have discussed how to approach
    problems, potential pitfalls and best practices.
    <br />
    <br /> I’m sure that Ehsan’s knowledge, curiosity and sense of team work
    will be a great asset to any organisation and I envy the next developer
    who gets to pick his brain.
    <br />
    <br />- It’s always time for tea…`,

        I had the pleasure of working with Ehsan during my first couple of years
        at Bredband2 (before he unfortunately moved on to take on new
        adventures). And let me tell you – I don’t think I’ve ever met someone
        as passionate and knowledgeable about “everything code” as him!
        <br />
        <br />
        Working with Ehsan means constantly being introduced to new ideas and
        interesting innovations. It’s about being challenged (in a good way!) in
        your ways of thinking, to find creative and efficient solutions to
        complex problems, and being confident that the code your team produces
        will adhere to best practices. But above all, it’s an absolute blast.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ehsan possesses the ability to see the whole picture, which enables him
        to produce quality products – even if the brief is a bit fuzzy. He has
        an eagerness to share his expertise and has, on countless occasions,
        made both our team and our department better by doing so. He also has a
        keen eye for design, which has made my job as a designer so much easier.
        <br />
        <br />
        Replacing him in our team will be a struggle, and I do hope our
        professional paths cross again in the future.
        <br />
        To anyone who has the opportunity to work with him: I’m jealous,

        <br />
        <br />
        His cheerful attitude is very valuable since he will uplift others,
        which in combination with his professional qualities makes him a really
        great and dedicated colleague. We shared many lunches, laughs and
        interesting conversations together.
        <br />I definitely recommend Ehsan for these reasons!

        kunskap i programmering och vilja att ligga i framkanten med ny teknik.

        Jag har haft äran att jobba tillsammans med Ehsan i båda stora och små
        team och projekt. <br />
        Han har en bra förmåga att snabbt sätta sig in i problemen som skall
        lösas och använda befintlig eller samla nya kunskaper för att lösa
        dessa. Vi har haft många bra stunder där vi har diskuterat programmering
        och problemlösning, nu senast i ett projekt involverat React och NextJS.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sammanfattningsvis anser jag Ehsan som en mycket skicklig och motiverad
        programmerare. Hans tekniska expertis, engagemang för självförbättring
        och anmärkningsvärda lagarbete gör dem till en oumbärlig medlem i alla
        organisationer. Jag tvivlar inte på att Ehsan kommer att fortsätta att
        ge betydande bidrag och nå stora framgångar i sina framtida
        ansträngningar.
